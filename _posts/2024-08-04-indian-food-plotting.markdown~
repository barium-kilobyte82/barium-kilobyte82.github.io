Hello Everyone! My name is Claire Chambers, and I'm a jack-of-all-trades programmer with sub-specialties in IT and Data Science. In my spare time, my main hobbies are cycling and being outdoors. I also spend a good deal of time helping others with their technical/computer issues, and provide free or low-cost support to people in need. This is my first blog post to test out a technical blog written in Jekyll. I'll be posting about computer science, IT, data analytics, and more!If any of the topics I post about interest you, feel free to find me on  [Linkedin][linkedin] or contact me via [email][work].
