# Introduction

India has a rapidly growing economy, especially in the IT and Data Science industries. Despite this rapid growth, hunger is still a major problem in India, with 60% of Indians making less than the artificially-low $3.00/day poverty line (more realistic projections place a living wage in India closer to $8/day). Food has long been recognized as a universal human right. The UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: “Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services”. Despite this, many Indians are clearly unable to avail themselves to this right. In this article, I will analyze a dataset of the prices of common Indian food staples to greater understand the Indian diet, the role various staple foods play in it, and how these foods are being and can be utilized to fight the battle against malnutrition. 


# Rice

Rice holds great dietary, cultural, and even spiritual significance in India. In fact, the most common long-grained variety of rice grown outside of Africa is named *Oryza Sativa var. Indica*, “Cultivated Indian Rice”. India is the second-largest producer of rice in the world, and its largest exporter. The crop is grown during the Kharif or monsoon season, predominately in 9 states (graph generated from Indian government metrics).
