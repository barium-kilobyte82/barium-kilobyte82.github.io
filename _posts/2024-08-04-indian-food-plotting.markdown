# Introduction

India has a rapidly growing economy, especially in the IT and Data Science industries. Despite this rapid growth, hunger is still a major problem in India, with 60% of Indians making less than the artificially-low $3.00/day poverty line (more realistic projections place a living wage in India closer to $8/day). Food has long been recognized as a universal human right. The UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: “Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services”. Despite this, many Indians are clearly unable to avail themselves to this right. In this article, I will analyze a dataset of the prices of common Indian food staples to greater understand the Indian diet, the role various staple foods play in it, and how these foods are being and can be utilized to fight the battle against malnutrition. 


# Rice

Rice holds great dietary, cultural, and even spiritual significance in India. In fact, the most common long-grained variety of rice grown outside of Africa is named *Oryza Sativa var. Indica*, “Cultivated Indian Rice”. India is the second-largest producer of rice in the world, and its largest exporter. The crop is grown during the Kharif or monsoon season, predominately in 9 states (graph generated from Indian government metrics).

As India, and West Bengal especially, export rice on a global scale, the prices of Rice in each particular state has been affected by global economic events, including the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis and the 2010 food price crisis. More local events impact the price as well, such as the 2016 South Indian drought. Rice is one of the most affordable staple foods for those in poverty, costing as little as 2 cents a serving, and can be used extensively in the diet, even as food for infants. Because of this, efforts have been made to increase the nutritional value of rice, ranging from simple enrichment with vitamins and minerals (Indians often wash their rice for sanitary reasons, which washes off many of the fortified nutrients, so this method isn’t quite effective for Asian countries, although quite successful in western countries) to methods like extrusion (creating  nutritious rice “kernels” from extruded, enriched rice flour) and even GMOs like the controversial “Golden Rice” (meant to supplement a vitamin A deficiency).  Fortified rice is also a common source of Iron, a nutrient that up to 53% of Indian women suffer from a deficiency of. While food insecurity is still a massive problem in India, I believe that nutritional fortification of food (and rice in particular) can serve as a powerful weapon against nutritional deficiencies caused by it. 


# Potatoes 

Potatoes have been an important part of the Indian diet for hundreds of years, serving important dietary and agricultural roles in the Indian food-basket. Potatoes, while sharing a similar macronutrient profile with rice, offer several key benefits nutritionally. Potatoes have a higher water content than rice, requiring much less water to cook. In addition, boiled or baked potatoes are one of the highest foods on the satiety index, which makes it desirableboth for those desiring to lose weight (like many developing and developed countries, India has high rates of obesity) and those with inadequate amounts of food wishing to feel full.  In addition, many varieties of potato contain high levels of antioxidants and nutrients, especially Potassium. Despite this, India has one of the lowest potassium intake levels of any country. While potatoes seem to cost less than rice, the cost per calorie is higher than rice, and rice has a much longer shelf life, allowing subsistence farmers to store or buy in bulk when it suits their income needs. It seems that while fortification would have the greatest impact on the consumption, price reduction would have a greater impact on the potato. If the potato were made cheaper (either through advancements in agricultural technology, logistics, or further advancements in preservation methods such as drying and freeze drying), then its nutritional benefits could be affordable to all Indians.

# Chickpeas and Lentils

Chickpeas and lentils are both legumes from the *Fabaceae* family and serve a crucial role in the diet of billions, and are such a reliable, affordable source of nutrition that the World Food Programme includes them in their food basket, a highly targeted program to improve nutrition in food-scarce areas (lentils have the second-highest ratio of protein per food energy of any legume, after soybeans). These legumes also serve as crucial sources of non-animal protein, made especially important by the fact that India’s population is, by some estimates, 20-30% vegetarian, with more not eating appreciable amounts of meat due to economic, religious, and cultural reasons.  By my estimates, lentils  provide approximately 2600 calories per US dollar, while chicken provides a comparatively modest 600 (meat also requires refrigeration, a technology only 30% of Indians by some estimates have access to). The prices of lentils and chickpeas are fairly close (although chickpeas rose quite a bit in comparison to lentils during the pandemic), and they have quite comparable nutrition in many aspects (although chickpeas have slightly higher fat, and lentils have slightly higher fiber). As for the future of this staple food, advancements have recently been made to even further improve the nutrition of lentils and chickpeas. In a manner much similar to rice, lentils can be turned into flour, fortified, and extruded into lentil-like shapes. One company that produces such a product claims that their “lentils” contain up to 30% more protein than non-extruded lentils. While I have not found any specific data about adoption rates for these fortified products, I have seen them in Indian/Pakistani stores in my local community, suggesting that they are well-tolerated enough to have a demand among expatriates.  Curiously, India makes great use of the chickpea and lentils even in their snack foods, using them to make a delicious crunchy mixture that’s higher in protein and fiber than many western snack foods.

# Conclusions 

After close examination of both the dataset and of several secondary sources, several important   conclusions can be drawn about the state of malnutrition in India. While political and economic solutions are the only way to ensure the elimination of malnutrition altogether, great strides can still be made in other areas. Fortification, for example, shows great promise, and would allow Indians who rely on one or two staple foods (E.G chickpeas and rice) to obtain essential supplies of vitamins, minerals, and macro-nutrients. In the United States, for example, iodization of salt and fortification of bread have almost eliminated several nutrient deficiencies. In the US, iodine deficiency goiter, ricketts, and iron-deficiency anemia have all been significantly reduced through fortification programs (crucially, however, a high-quality dietary source of non-heme iron for those who cannot afford or do not want to eat meat, would be another major breakthrough in the fight against malnutrition. Iron anemia can be a major problem in the developed world as well; two of the author’s family members have some form of the disease, despite adequate meat consumption. While these conclusions are certainly for another article, perhaps globalizing the currently local practice of eating food mixed with animal blood, which is rich in high-quality heme iron, and can even be said to add a delicious taste to traditional dishes such as Diniguan, a Filipino pork and pork blood stew. While there are certainly cultural and food safety concerns about hematophagy, perhaps further advancements in processing could develop culinary blood-based food seasonings or supplements).  Advancements in chemical processes to produce the fortificants ) In addition to fortified food, advancements in agriculture have a large role to play. Mechanization, for example, would allow Indian farmers to grow more food with less work, leading to higher yields and lower costs across the board. Advancements in fertilizer, too, can allow farmers to grow crops more often and on less arable land (fertilizer is such a powerful factor in the global food supply that the inventors of the Haber-Bosch process, one of the first methods to make artificial fertilizer,  won Nobel Prizes.)
